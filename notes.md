# SLIP Notes

- next

 - conversions
  + rational
  - rationalize (same as rational but try simplify or maybe work with orginal if float)
   - or just shift float left or right until int64 is same
   - maybe to string and process that first
   - or
    - abs
    - keep shifting until if 1 <= x (limit to 20? shifts)
     - x *= 10 then abs(float(int(x)) - x) < (x * 0.1e-16) (or some limit) then use that
      - limit based on x
     - limit num and denom to max-int/10
  - coerce
  - identity
  - parse-float (in gi package?, no cl anyway)
   - parse-float string &key start end default-format => float
   - parse-float string &key type start end
   - parse-float (string &key start end radix junk-allowed decimal-character exponent-character type)

 - http package
  - flavors
   - server
    - start
    - shutdown
    - add-handler (path handler)
   - request
    - method
    - url
    - headers
    - body
    - trailers
    - remote-address
    - proto
   - response
    - write
    - add-header
    - :status
    - :headers
    - body
    - trailers
    - proto
   - some common base for request and response (http-message)
    -
   - handler
    - handle (req resp)
    - subclass for file and static pages (string)
  - client
   - get
   - put
   - post
   - etc

 - merge (starts with result-type)
 - room

 - package
  - support export list
   - ListToFunc should be f.ListToFunc
    - lookup of func should consider the package of f
     - if lookup is in f.pkg or lookup is exported (new flag) then ok
    - add export flag to FuncInfo
    - Define() and package.Define() need extra arg for export or not
     - maybe default to export
     - flag in FuncDoc or separate? depends on whether it's useful in docs

 - future repl options
  - color for words
   - functions - word after (
   - variables - match word
   - strings - quotes
   - comments - ;;
  - select, copy, yank, ring (stack) (is this really needed?)
   - need select
    - mark
    - highlight from mark to current
    - ^w to delete
    - M-w to copy
   - ^y for yank
   - M-y for next
   - need hookup with system copy and paste

 - coerce
  - also support integers unlike CL
  - only support symbols (later lists like '(integer 3 5) or '(and list (not null)) )


 - macro
  - expand on read

- base64 (encode and decode in gi package)

 - other method combinations?
  - :method-combination option for defflavor
  - daemon (default)
  - progn
  - or
  - and
  - list


- would building our own stack be a better approach?
 - could reuse scope but would need to clear vars
 - could replace args key lookups for lispcaller with an index to arg to avoid using maps


- support marcos
 - represented as scoped fun
 - support macro chars of , and ,@ in a backquoted (not single quote) list
  - , eval
  - ,@ is like: if foo is (a b) the ,@foo becomes a b
  - ', as is, no eval, (as string?)
  - https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/blog/common-lisp-macros-by-example-tutorial/
  - defmacro defined should expand at compile time
  - golang macro should just not eval args
